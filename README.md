## Use Cases

I use it when I travel to other countries and need an estimate of a price in a currency I'm familiar with. It doesn't even have to be an exact exchange rate, just something near enough to give me idea.

Claude, on the other hand, thinks of the below use cases:

1. **Travel Planning**

    - Quickly check prices when booking hotels or activities abroad
    - Convert daily budget to local currency
    - Compare prices across different destinations

2. **Online Shopping**

    - Convert prices from international e-commerce sites
    - Compare prices across different regional stores
    - Calculate total cost including shipping in your local currency

3. **Business**

    - Quick currency conversions during international meetings
    - Estimate project costs across different regions
    - Convert salaries or contract rates

4. **Personal Finance**
    - Track international investments
    - Convert remittance amounts
    - Compare costs of living between countries

The app's quick adjustment buttons (×10, ÷10, ↑, ↓) make it particularly useful for rapidly exploring different amounts without typing.
